# Bing_Web_Scraper

This is a simple web scraper for the Bing search engine. Rather than collect data manually yourself, this program can collect
links or images by itself.

1. Pass in your choice for whether you wish to collect links or images.
2. Enter the search term that you want to search

A list of links will appear in the terminal
Images will make their own directory and be downloaded to it themselves.
